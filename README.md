# Cytomine software - Segment-CV-AdaptThres-Sample

Segmentation of samples using Computer Vision (CV) Adaptive Thresholding.

-------------

* **Summary:** It applies a thresholding algorithm to a thumbnail of a whole image (downloaded
from Cytomine-Core) and upload detected geometries to Cytomine-Core (in a userjob layer)

* **Typical application:** Detect sample regions before applying other algorithms (e.g. segmentation)

* **Based on:** Adaptive Thresholding (https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d7/d4d/tutorial_py_thresholding.html) but code can be easily adapted to other thresholding algorithms.
